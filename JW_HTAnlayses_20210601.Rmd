#Data cleaning

- For some reason the column numbers when you look at the df are wrong, so when using *mutate_at()*, use *which(colnames(df2)=="BOI_Professional_Eff_6")* to find true column numers to use (not in this code bc I used the console)!

# Quick and Dirty Analyses: Moderation
- https://statsnotebook.io/blog/analysis/moderation_interaction_regression/   
  + See "Numeric independent variable and numeric moderator"   
- Moderation analysis is used to examine if the effect of an independent variable on the dependent variable is the same across different levels of another independent variable (moderator). In other words, it is used to examine whether the moderator will change the strength of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.  

## HONORS THESIS RESULTS
Stress Mindset and Self-Theory of Intelligence were independently examined as moderators of the relation between COVID-19 Impact and academic stress and COVID-19 Impact and academic burnout Stress mindset, but not theory of intelligence was a marginally significant moderator for academic stress. Students who view stress as debilitating show a greater impact of COVID on academic stress (b = -0.24, 95% CI = [-0.597, 0.010], F(3,175) = -0.086, Î·2 = 0.021, p = 0.058); however, this pattern is specific, and stress mindset does not apply moderate the relationship between COVID-19 impact and academic burnout (p = 0.7). 

Significant Simple slopes revealed that students who view stress as more debilitating see a greater impact of COVID-19 on academic stress than those who view stress as enhancing. Simple slope for student 1 SD below the mean of stress mindset was 2.70 (b = 0.49, t = 5.07, p<.001), the simple slope for stress mindset with a mean level of academic stress was 3.14 (b = 0.39, t = 4.37, p<.001), and the simple slope for stress mindset 1 SD above the mean of academic stress was 3.58 (b = 0.23, t = 1.98, p=.048; see Figure X).

### 1. Burnout = b0 + b1Impact + b2StressMindset + b3Impact*StressMindset + e

- Impact and Stress mindset are significant predictors, there is a marginally significant interaction (p=0.058) suggesting a moderating effect.  
- Simple slopes: students who view stress as more debilitating (black solid line) see a greater impact of covid on academic stress than those who view stress as enhancing (green dotted line).  All 3 simple slopes are significant.

### Burnout = b0 + b1Impact + b2Academic Stress+ b3Impact* Academic Stress    + e
- Academic Stress is a significant predictor of burnout (p=0.04), but the significant effect of COVID impact has disappeared (p=0.1)  
- There is a significant interaction between Academic Stress and COVID Impact (p=0.19)   
- Simple slopes suggest as COVID-impact increases, students with average and high levels of academic stress were more likely to report being burnout.

# Quick and Dirty Analyses: Mediation 
- https://data.library.virginia.edu/introduction-to-mediation-analysis/

## Q1: Does stressmindset mediate the relationship between Covid impact and Burnout?  
- Stress mindset partially mediates this relationship (b = 0.06, p = 0.036). Such that 

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## Set up our variables 
set.seed(1234)                              # Set seed for reproducible results with bootstrapping 

X <- df2$CABP_Impact2                       # Our predictor (X) 
M <- df2$SMM                                # Our mediator (M)
Y <- df2$BOI_tot                            # Our outcome (Y) 
M1_data <- data.frame(X = X, Y = Y, M = M)  # Put our variables into a dataframe

## Q1: Relationship between predictor and outcome? Yes
model.0 <- lm(Y ~ X, M1_data)
summary(model.0)

## Q2: Relationship between predictor and mediator? Yes
model.M <- lm(M ~ X, M1_data)
#summary(model.M)

## Q3: Is  b4  non-significant or smaller than before? 
model.Y <- lm(Y ~ X + M, M1_data)
#summary(model.Y)

## Run bootsrapping 
results <- mediate(model.M, model.Y, treat='X', mediator='M',
                   boot=TRUE, sims=500)
summary(results)

#For reading results output:
### ACME stands for Average Causal Mediation Effects, this is our effect of interest
### ADE stands for Average Direct Effects, this is the relationship for X and Y after accounting for our mediator 
### Total Effect is a sum of a mediation (indirect) effect and a direct effect

```


## Q2: Does Self-theory mindset mediate the relationship between Covid impact and Burnout? 
-  There was no relationship between Covid impact and growth mindset, leaving no grounds for medication
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## Set up our variables 
set.seed(1234)                              # Set seed for reproducible results with bootstrapping

Y <- df2$BOI_tot                            # Our outcome (Y) 
M2_data <- data.frame(X = X, Y = Y, M = M)  # Put our variables into a dataframe

## Q1: Relationship between predictor and outcome? Yes
model.02 <- lm(Y ~ X, M2_data)
summary(model.02)

## Q2: Relationship between predictor and mediator? 
### NO! No grounds for mediation
model.M2 <- lm(M ~ X, M2_data)
summary(model.M2)

```

## Q3: Does Academic stress mediate the relationship between Covid impact and Burnout?
-  Yes, when including academic stress as a mediator, the direct effect of covid impact on burnout disappears
